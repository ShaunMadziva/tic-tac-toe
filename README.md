# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Plan:

- 3 x 3 grid
- Make Your Mark
- Take Turns “X” and “O”
- Win Logic: align 3 in a row, in a column, or diagonally
- Declare a Tie
- The Game is Finished

## Improvements:

- Make it so the game doesn't continue after a winner is announced
- Make it so players can keep score
- Make it so players have the option of who can go first (right now, X always goes first)
- Make it so after a square is filled in with one mark it cannot be changed
